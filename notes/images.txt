Use a PNG image and place the image in the directory src/Desktop/images directory.  In the same directory, edit the file resources.qrc and add the image.

In the code, to load the image, use one of the "load" methods in WuQtUtilities.

In the load methods, prefix the file name with ":/" which tells Qt that the image should be loaded from resources.

Delete Desktop from your build directory, rerun cmake, and then build. This step must be done after images.qrc has been edited or touched.
