Connectome Workbench requires QT4 to compile.  Recommended is the latest 4.8.x release.  The following configure options were used on linux for our builds:

-system-zlib -webkit -qt-libmng -qt-libpng -qt-libtiff -qt-libjpeg -nomake demos -nomake examples -no-qt3support -no-dbus -opensource -exceptions -stl -no-multimedia -no-phonon -no-audio-backend -openssl

It is currently set up to be compiled by cmake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
#OR
cmake-gui ../src
make [-j cores]

This produces 3 executables, 2 of which are useful to the end user (Desktop/workbench, CommandLine/wb_command), and one for running internal tests (Tests/test_driver).  Install them however you see fit.

It should be noted that wb_import, provided in the HCP binary releases of Connectome Workbench, is actually part of caret5 (http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:Download).

To run the (few) tests available:

ctest
#OR
make test
